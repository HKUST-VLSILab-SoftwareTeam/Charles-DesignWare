2.Derating Factors
  The derating factors of VeriSilicon SMIC 0.13um High-Density Standared Cell Library given 
  in document SMIC13HT-SC.pdf are for pre-layout estimation only.
  
3.Synopsys Model

  a.The wire load models given in our synopsys library are for your REFERENCE ONLY. So please
    create a customized wire load model appropriate for your design.

  b.Please consider for which cell, if any, should be added dont_use and dont_touch during 
    synthesis and ignore our settings.

  c.Since our synthesis tools' version may be different from yours, it is recommended that you
    create the db file using your own library compiler tools.

  d.When reading in the model, synopsys tools will give some warning which should be ignored. The following is the warning list to be ignored:

Warning: Line xxx, The 'values' attribute has a '-x.xxxxxx' value,
        which is less than '0.000000' the minimum recommended value of this attribute. (LBDB-272)

Warning: Line xxx, The 'SN' pin of the 'XXXX' design is not a clock pin
and should not be used in the 'related_pin' of 'setup' timing arc. (LIBG-104)

Warning: Line xx, The 'Z' Pin/bus on the 'HOLDHD' cell has no 'function' a
ttribute.
        The cell becomes a black box. (LIBG-16)

Information: Line 197792, No internal_power information for the 'TIEHHDHT' cell. (LBDB-301)

Information: Line 197792, No internal_power information for the 'TIELHDHT' cell. (LBDB-301)


4.Ambit Sdf Writing
  When using Ambit to write 2.1 version sdf, please use this option 
  "-edges edged". The following is the eample:

  ac_shell> write_sdf -version 2.1 -interconn all -edges edged -splitsethold design.sdf

5.SDF file 
  If you generate version 2.1 sdf file using synopsys design compiler(Version 2002.08 or 
  later) or Ambit, please use the script Modify_SDF_2_1.pl to modify
  the sdf file before doing back-annotation using Verilog-XL.

  file : Synopsys/Modify_SDF_2_1.pl 

  cmd line : Modify_SDF_2_1.pl sdf_file

  result : sdf_file - can be used for back-annotation
           sdf_file.bak - back-up file 

6.Formality comment
  If your design can not pass Synopsys Formality tool, commenting the cell HOLDHDHT from your design   may help you.

7. Cell list comment
  There are 581 basic cells in the library and add 9 FILLERC*HD cells in floorplan view.

8. SDF back-annotation simulation
  When doing sdf back-annotation in VCS(V6.2 and above), the option "+overlap" is necessary and the following 
warning may appears.
  Warning : The sum of a negative timing check limits should be greater than or equal to 0. Setting negative
limits to 0. ("<verilog_model_filename>", xxxx).
