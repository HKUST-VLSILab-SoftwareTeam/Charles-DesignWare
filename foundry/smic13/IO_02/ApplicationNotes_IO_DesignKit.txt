2.Derating Factors
  The derating factors of VeriSilicon SMIC 0.13um 1.2V/3.3V IO Cell Library given
  in document SMIC13-IO-02.pdf are for pre-layout estimation only.

3.Synopsys Model

  a.The wire load models given in our synopsys library are for your REFERENCE ONLY. So please
    create a customized wire load model appropriate for your design.

  b.Please consider for which cell, if any, should be added dont_use and dont_touch during 
    synthesis and ignore our settings.

  c.Since our synthesis tools' version may be different from yours, it is recommended that you
    create the db file using your own library compiler tools.

  d.When reading in the model, synopsys tools will give some warning which should be ignored. The following is the warning list to be ignored:
Warning: Line xx, The 'PLOSC14M' pad cell has more than one pad pin.
        Using the first pin specified. (LBDB-207)

4.Ambit Sdf Writing
  When using Ambit to write 2.1 version sdf, please use this option 
  "-edges edged". The following is the eample:

  ac_shell> write_sdf -version 2.1 -interconn all -edges edged -splitsethold design.sdf

5.SDF file 
  If you generate version 2.1 sdf file using synopsys design compiler(Version 2002.08 or 
  later) or Ambit, please use the script Modify_SDF_2_1.pl to modify
  the sdf file before doing back-annotation using Verilog-XL.

  file : Synopsys/Modify_SDF_2_1.pl 

  cmd line : Modify_SDF_2_1.pl sdf_file

  result : sdf_file - can be used for back-annotation
           sdf_file.bak - back-up file 

6. Cell list comment
  There are 17 basic cells in both stagger library and inlined library. In verilog model, PS|LVDD* and PS|LVSS* is added. In Floorplan view, PS|LVDD*, PS|LVSS*,
 PS|LBIA and PS|LBIAR is added.
