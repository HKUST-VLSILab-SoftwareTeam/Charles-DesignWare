# CharlesDesignWare

The design ware initialized by Charles, publishing standard Verilog modules and data path circuits for agile development of your own VLSI circuits.  

Part of the codes are written by GPT4.  

All published code have been tested with UT sanity test cases. Welcome to contribute white-box SVA and test cases.  

Testing data path circuits with Formality is a plan once I bought the tool.
